# MCRand
MCRand is a random number generator library based on Monte Carlo methods.

# Example
In the [MCRand_tests](/MCRand_tests.py) you can find a comparison between MCRand and Numpy. As an example we use the gaussian distribution and obtain the following values for the probability density function.
